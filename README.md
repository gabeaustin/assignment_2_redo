# Assignment 2 Redo

- [x] Use the GitHub repository and project created for your previous assignment.
- [ ] Modify your web page so that it has three <section> HTML content areas. Use the id attribute to create unique identifiers for each area.
- [x] In one section, create a page and the appropriate code to display the customer list returned by the getAllCustomers service on the web server. Display the list in a table with appropriate headings.  The service will return the Customer Name, Customer ID, and City.
- [ ] In another section, create a page and the appropriate code to display a customerâ€™s order history. Create an input field to allow the user to enter the Customer ID for which to get the order history.  The service will return the Product Names and Quantities ordered.  The service name is getCustomerOrderHistory.  Use the GET method to send the Customer ID.
- [ ] In the third section, create an About page for your app. Display your name and information about your app in this area.
- [ ] Add a hyperlink to each entry in the customer list that invokes a function to display the items ordered by that customer. Create the function and code necessary to display the order list for a customer when the link for that customer is clicked.
- [ ] Display all output received from the services in table form.
- [ ] At the top of the web page use a <select> tag to create a dropdown menu.
- [ ] Arrange the web page so that none of the sections is visible when the web page is loaded.
- [ ] Upon selecting the appropriate menu item, display the selected area and remove the area that was previously displayed.
- [ ] Create a Back button on the order history display area that returns the user to the customer list display.
- [ ] Using a style sheet, format the web page so that the input and output areas are clearly defined and the contents are neatly organized. Use the positioning attributes so that the two content areas display in the same place on the web page.  The content areas should be 600 pixels in width.
- [ ] Synchronize your GitHub repository with your Github account. Log into PhoneGap and create a new app.  Copy the URL to your Github repository on the web and paste it to the PhoneGap app screen.  Issue a pull command in PhoneGap to load the code to your application.
- [ ] Build your app and test it on your mobile device.
- [ ] Upon completion, submit your work by saving the project and folder structure in a Zip file and submit the Zip file through the assignment submission link. Copy the URL to the app you created on PhoneGap and submit it.
